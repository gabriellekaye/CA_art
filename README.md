# CA_art
Asynch learning task for cellular automata by Gabrielle Naval

To set up the CA model, I reused the CA 1D Elementary model that is available in the models' library, as seen below.

Detailed documentation regarding the model is found here: https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/CA1DElementary 

I then created different artworks by adjusting the rule slider and for each rule chosen tried both setups (single and random) to see what would show up. Density was set to 57% and auto-continue was off for all runs.
